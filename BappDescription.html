<p>This extension automatically rotates IP addresses by routing traffic through AWS API Gateway endpoints across
    multiple regions. Each request is sent through a different regional gateway, effectively changing the source IP
    address to bypass IP-based blocking mechanisms.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Spin up API Gateways across 10 AWS regions for maximum IP diversity</li>
    <li>Automatic rotation through endpoints on each request</li>
    <li>Support for both HTTP and HTTPS protocols</li>
    <li>Real-time status monitoring with enable/disable toggle</li>
    <li>Configurable target domain specification</li>
    <li>Automatic resource cleanup when disabled</li>
    <li>Built-in AWS credentials management</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Configure AWS credentials with API Gateway permissions in the extension interface</li>
    <li>Specify the target domain you wish to route traffic through</li>
    <li>Select the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) based on your target</li>
    <li>Choose which AWS regions to utilize for the IP pool</li>
    <li>Click <code class="InlineCode">Enable</code> to create API Gateway endpoints</li>
    <li>Send requests normally &rarr; traffic will automatically rotate through different IP addresses</li>
    <li>Click <code class="InlineCode">Disable</code> when finished to clean up AWS resources</li>
</ol>

<p>The extension is particularly useful for bypassing rate limiting, brute force protection, and WAF rules that
    implement IP-based blocking. All requests to the configured target domain are automatically intercepted and routed
    through the rotating gateway endpoints.</p>
